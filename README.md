JUnit- Java Framework for write test cases to test functionality/methods

Why JUnit Test Cases:

1. To find bugs early in the development phase, which increases the codeâ€™s reliability

3. This makes the code more readable, reliable, and bug-free
4. It boosts the confidence of the developer and motivates them immensely
